# About

This is basically a mini calculator to practice my Frontend skills. This calculator handles
multiplication , division , subtraction and division. The AC button resets the calculator 
while the DEL  button is used to delete a number if the user clicks on a button by mistake.
The = button is used to calculate the result of an expression.

It should be noted that the calculator only evaluates a single pair of numbers at a time.
For example, if a user presses 1 then + and then another number say 7 and then another
operator say - then the result of 1 + 7 = 8 will be displayed on the screen.
